# WordPressVerySimpleNotificationAdminBar
for my personal site where I need to remember to turn on/off "discourage google..." / no-index I have a big fat red notification bar at the top to remind me


It is a WordPress plugin its about 7 lines of code plus comments self contained in 1 php file. enjoy!
